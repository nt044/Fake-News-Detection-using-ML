# Fake-News-Detection-using-ML
## ðŸ“ŒProject Overview
In this project work, we present an ensemble approach for the detection of forged or fake news. Our methodology involves a comprehensive comparative analysis of different ensemble techniques, specifically focusing on Bagging and Boosting Classifiers. These ensemble models leverage base estimators, including LSVM, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes, utilizing both soft and hard voting classifiers.
## ðŸ“ŒEnsemble techniques explored
### Bagging 
- Base Estimators: LSVM, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes.
- Voting Classifiers: Soft and Hard Voting.
### Boosting
- Base Estimators: LSVM, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes.
- Boosting Algorithms: Gradient Boosting, Adaboost.
### Stacking
- Combination of various ensemble models as base estimators.
## ðŸ“ŒDataset
The classifiers are rigorously tested on a dataset obtained freely from the Kaggle platform. This dataset is carefully curated to cover a diverse range of news articles, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of our ensemble models.
## ðŸ“Œ Result and Analysis
After extensive testing and evaluation, our comparative analysis reveals that the Stacking Classifier outperforms other classifiers in terms of accuracy and reliability. The Stacking Classifier demonstrates superior capabilities in discerning between genuine and fake news, making it the standout performer among the ensemble models considered.
